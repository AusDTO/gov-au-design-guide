## Setup

## Running + developing
Clone the repository

Make sure Node and npm are installed. A great guide can be found here: [https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

Install dependencies using `npm install`

Install grunt command using `npm install -g grunt-cli`

Run `grunt` or `grunt serve` from the command line

This creates all patterns, the UDG, and the UDG site. It's strongly recommended to run `grunt serve` to have BrowserSync spin up and serve the files to you.
